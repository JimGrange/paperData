	task-switching experiments examine this decay process. Each shows
	within-run slowing, a performance decline occurring as memory for

	memory for the task is optional, suggesting that memory is indeed
	causal. Experiment 2 finds slowing despite a flat hazard rate for

	Subjects may perform both tasks by using a compound-stimulus strategy,

	suggesting that cue repetition effects account for the bulk of the

	In one condition both tasks required the same set of responses, hence

	2). Results will be discussed with respect to cognitive control.},

	when switching back to a task from which one has recently switched
	away. This alternating-switch cost is considered to be due to persisting
	inhibition of elements of the previous task set after a switch. In
	this study, patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease and
	controls performed three tasks (A-C) in an intermixed fashion. Patients
	with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease and controls showed equivalent

	CBA). In addition, accuracy for the two groups was similar for trials

	the results of a new study in which we used "transition cues" that

	the preceding task. This new type of cue allows a full factorial
	manipulation of cue switches and task switches because it includes
	the condition in which a cue repetition can also indicate a task

	study, we aimed at investigating different degrees of endogenous
	control by introducing two cue types with varying directness of the
	cue-task association. The "transition cues" informed the participants
	about repeating or switching the task but not about the task identity.
	Contrary to that, the "task cues" were directly associated with the
	upcoming task set. Since the transition cues are not directly associated
	with the task set they should require a higher demand of endogenous
	control than the task cues. The comparison of both cue types revealed
	frontolateral as well as frontomedian activations for the transition
	cue. We assume that the frontolateral activation reflects the coordination
	of information within working memory (WM) and the frontomedian cortex
	reflects the higher demand for endogenous control. Furthermore, regions
	of interest (ROIs) analyses indicate an important role for anterior
	regions along the left inferior frontal sulcus and frontomedian wall.

	These associations lead to retrieval of the associated task set once

	using a negative transfer paradigm. First participants were exposed

	changed in either of two ways. Whereas one group of participants
	got new cues, the other experienced a reversal of the learnt cue-task

	Prevailing accounts of the phenomenon attribute it to a variety of
	causes, all centered on a representation of the stimulus event itself.
	However, we argue that the most commonly used NP paradigms confound
	stimulus- and response-based factors. In two experiments, we demonstrate
	the importance of response factors in producing NP and show clear
	empirical dissociations between object- and response-centered NP
	when studying their time courses over extended practice. When distractors
	compete for a response (response-based), the NP effect is both more
	robust and more resistant to the effects of practice. On the other
	hand, when prime distractors do not compete for response (object-based),
	they yield weaker NP effects that disappear with practice. We conclude
	that the NP effects shown in the most common procedures are produced
	by a combination of distinct factors that tend to act in the same
	direction.},

	The question arises as to precisely what aspects of a task may be
	inhibited and when the process takes place. Recent work has suggested
	a crucial role for response-related components of the task, which
	occur late in the typical trial structure (cue-target-response).
	In contrast to this suggestion, the authors present evidence that
	the way in which the task is cued can also modulate BI. Specifically,
	they find that the less transparent the cue-target relationship,
	the greater the level of BI. This also demonstrates that BI can be
	triggered at early stages of the trial structure, specifically during
	task preparation and prior to response processes. The authors conclude
	that BI is not tied to any particular component of the task structure

  abstract = {A growing number of studies on the higher-order cognitive functions
	of the human brain use brain-imaging techniques, such as functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). For the validity and generality
	of fMRI results, it is important that the relevant cognitive processes
	are equivalent to those functioning in typical settings used in behavioral
	research. This equivalence could be, for example, endangered by different
	spatial frames of reference when lying in the scanner. In the present
	study, we tested whether the cognitive processes, as reflected in
	behavioral data in brain-imaging settings, are indeed functionally
	equivalent to those reflected in "purely" behavioral settings. To
	this end, we used a task-switching paradigm with a spatial component,
	increasing the likelihood to find effects of experimental setting.
	We compared the data of three different groups that only differed
	in testing environments (real, operating fMRI vs simulated fMRI vs
	standard behavioral with upright position of participants) but used
	otherwise strictly equivalent experimental conditions. Of importance
	for our validation purposes, unlike previous studies, we included
	a group with a behavioral setting, and we tested whether we would
	replicate a nontrivial, complex three-way interaction across all
	three groups. We replicated the predicted complex data pattern in
	all groups, suggesting functional equivalence of the underlying cognitive
	processes. We also found strongly increased reaction time (RT) levels
	in the two fMRI groups. We attribute this increase to unspecific
	distracting factors affecting late motor processes and discuss potential
	methodological implications of this increased baseline RT in the

	task alternation because the appropriate task settings are already

	must be retrieved from long-term memory (Mayr & Kliegl, 2000). The
	present study tested whether the phonological loop is involved in
	keeping the relevant task settings active in working memory. It may
	then be expected that concurrent articulatory suppression would diminish
	the facilitation associated with task repetition because the phonological
	loop could no longer maintain the appropriate task settings active
	in working memory. Both during task repetition and task alternation
	the relevant task settings should then be retrieved from long-term
	memory. Three dual-task experiments were conducted. The results of
	Experiment 1 were in support of our prediction. Experiment 2 replicated
	the findings of Experiment 1 and showed that the task settings probably
	represent the adequate response mappings. Experiment 3 ruled out
	the involvement of the visuo-spatial sketchpad and more general coordination
	demands during dual tasking.},

	costs are sensitive to the relative probability of cue switches versus
	task switches. From this they concluded that task-switch costs reflect
	priming of cue-cue transitions rather than actual task-switching
	operations. However, because this design confounded probability of
	specific cue transitions with probability of task switches, the results
	could also reflect task-switch-level adjustments. The present experiment
	(N = 80) pits the critical prediction of the cue-priming account,
	namely that costs for high-probability cue-cue transitions are smaller
	than for low-probability cue-cue transitions, against the main prediction
	of the switch-probability account, namely that switch probability,
	irrespective of specific cue-cue transitions, determines switch costs.
	Whereas the cue-priming prediction was rejected, a specific version
	of the probability account--that subjects are sensitive to the probability
	of a task switch, given a cue switch--was fully confirmed. Thus,
	tasks are in fact the critical representational units that determine

	greater switching costs, were as efficient as controls in engaging

	To test this notion, the authors subsequently tested normal participants

  abstract = {Three experiments investigated the cognitive mechanisms underlying
	the restart cost and mixing cost in task switching. To this aim,
	the predictability of task order was varied (unpredictable in Experiment
	1 and predictable in Experiments 2 and 3) across experiments, which
	employed a multiple-trial paradigm. Verbal cues for color and shape
	matching tasks were presented before a run of four trials. Focusing
	on task-repetition runs only, we measured restart cost as the difference
	in performance between trials 1 and 2 and mixing cost as the difference
	in performance on the non-cued trials under mixed-tasks conditions
	(Experiments 1 and 2) and single-task conditions (Experiment 3).
	The restart cost was observed under mixed-tasks conditions with both
	unpredictable and predictable task orders but not under the single-task
	condition. In contrast, the mixing cost was observed under the mixed-tasks
	condition with unpredictable task order only (Experiment 1). This
	finding implies that the optimal task execution on repetition trials
	depends on how predictable the identity of the approaching task is.
	Therefore, we suggest that mixing cost arises from limited preparation
	on repetition trials when task order is unpredictable, while restart
	cost arises from processes involved in cue-based task activation
	that is needed to resolve task interference. Together, these data
	suggest that restart cost and mixing cost are based on dissociable
	mechanisms.},

  volume = {36},
  pages = {998--1012},
  abstract = {In previous studies of task switching and of the right-left prevalence
	effect, researchers have used a procedure in which the stimulus on
	each trial occurs in one of four quadrants, and responses are made
	by pressing one of two diagonally arranged response keys. Across
	these studies, discrepant effects of cuing interval have been reported.
	These discrepancies need clarification because cue-based preparation
	effects are frequently interpreted as reflecting cognitive control
	processes. In Experiment 1, we compared performance with display
	formats used by Meiran (1996; Meiran, Chorev, & Sapir, 2000; small
	display, cues located at sides of quadrants and displayed until response)
	to study task switching and by Proctor and colleagues (Proctor, Koch,
	& Vu, 2006; large display, cues located at center of display and
	shown until target onset) to study right-left prevalence. We found
	a decrease in task-switch cost with increasing cuing interval with
	the Meiran display, but not with the Proctor display, but the right-left
	prevalence effect was of similar size for the two display formats
	and was relatively unaffected by cuing interval. To determine the
	basis of the discrepant task-switch results, we used small and large
	displays in Experiments 2 and 3, respectively, with cue type and
	cue offset varied. With the side cues, the task-switch cost decreased
	in all cases at the longer cuing interval, but with the centered
	cues, it decreased only when the display size was small. Thus, the
	effects of cuing interval on switch costs are sensitive to variations
	of display characteristics, whereas cuing interval and display characteristics
	have little influence on the right-left prevalence effect, suggesting
	that prevalence effect is due to processes that are independent from
	those producing the switch cost.},

	(CTI-2000) with a situation where cue and target were presented in
	close succession (CTI-100). We mapped the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
	(BOLD) activation correlates of switch-related control effort and
	advance task preparation to test alternative explanations why advance
	preparation is reducing switch costs. A previously reported control-related
	cortical network of frontal and parietal brain areas emerged that
	was more strongly activated for switching between tasks. However,
	this was true exclusively for CTI-100 where no advance task preparation
	was possible. At CTI-2000 these same brain areas were equally engaged
	in both switch and repeat trials. For some of these areas, this common
	activation was time-locked to the presentation of both the cue as
	well as the target. Other areas were exclusively associated with
	target processing. The overall pattern of results suggests that advance
	task preparation is a common process of pre-activating (cue-locked
	activation) the currently relevant task set which does not face interference
	from a persisting N - 1 task set. During target processing the same
	brain areas are re-engaged (subsequent target-locked activation)
	to apply the pre-activated task set. Though being common to repeat
	and switch trials, advance preparation has a differential benefit
	for switch trials. This is because the instructed task set has time
	to settle into a stable state, thus becoming resistant against disruption

  abstract = {Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) typically show reduced performance
	in clinical tests involving cognitive control processes, presumably
	due to reduced availability of dopamine in striatofrontal neuronal
	circuits. Although task switching paradigms are considered as an
	ideal experimental measure of cognitive control, previous studies
	on task switching in PD have yielded ambiguous results, indicating
	that performance deficits depend on the specific task requirements.
	Among these, the aspect of self-initiated as opposed to externally
	triggered task preparation seems to play an important role, as evidenced
	by recent research. To address this topic, the present study investigated
	PD patients and age-matched controls (n=16) with a sequential switching
	task in which the upcoming task was predicted by two different types
	of cues. Firstly, every task was predicted by an external visual
	cue of varying utility (long versus short precuing interval). Additionally,
	the tasks were predictable on the basis of a fixed task sequence
	(AABB), which placed relatively higher demands on self-initiated
	task preparation. After considerable practice, the sequence was changed
	to random. Increased reaction times following sequence removal indicated
	prior use of the sequence in both groups. However, in contrast to
	healthy age-matched controls, PD patients did not learn to use the
	predictable task sequence to a greater extent when the utility of
	the visual task cue was low due to a short precuing interval. This
	finding is interpreted as evidence for a specific impairment in self-initiated

  abstract = {Participants were tested on two analogous task switching paradigms
	involving Shape/Size tasks and Vertical/Horizontal tasks, respectively,
	and three measures of psychometric intelligence, tapping fluid, crystallized
	and perceptual speed abilities. The paradigms produced similar patterns
	of group mean reaction times (RTs) and the vast majority of the participants
	showed switching cost (switch RT minus repeat RT), mixing cost (repeat
	RT minus single-task RT) and congruency effects. The shared intra-individual
	variance across paradigms and with psychometric intelligence served
	as criteria for general ability. Structural equations modeling indicated
	that switching cost with ample preparation ("residual cost") and
	mixing cost met these criteria. However, switching cost with little
	preparation and congruency effects were predominantly paradigm specific.},

	the specific role of the BG within the frontal-subcortical circuits
	(FSCC) in task switching. All the BG patients and none of the other
	participants showed a marked increase in error rate in incongruent
	trials where correct responses depended upon the choice of the correct
	task rule. Some BG patients erred in failing to switch tasks and
	others failed despite their attempt to switch tasks. Additionally,
	reaction time results indicate abnormal response repetition effects
	among the BG patients; failure in benefiting from advance task information
	among all the patients; and increased task mixing costs following
	PFC lesions. The authors conclude that although the frontal-subcortical
	circuits jointly determine some behaviors (such as benefiting from
	preparation), the BG play a unique role within the FSCC in action
	selection and/or the inhibition of irrelevant information.},

  volume = {43},
  pages = {1858--1869},
  abstract = {A behavioral dissociation between intention and action was demonstrated
	by patient AF who sustained damage to the left-hemisphere including
	the basal ganglia. The patient was tested in a task switching paradigm
	involving two choice reaction-time tasks: SIZE (small/large) and
	SHAPE (circle/square). The last block in each of the two sessions
	involved only one task. AF switched tasks reasonably well in the
	first 40 trials, but unlike her matched control group, in all the
	remaining trials when two tasks were involved, she performed only
	the SIZE task. Interestingly, although no task switching took place,
	AF continued to demonstrate behaviorally her intention to switch
	tasks. First, she exhibited "task alternation cost", poorer performance
	relative to instructed single-task trials. Second, shifting to an
	instructed single-task condition was accompanied by an initial response
	slowing, indicating a change in goal-state. Finally, when instructed
	to switch tasks, AF demonstrated the "task-congruency effect", indicating
	interference from the instructed but competing stimulus-response
	mapping. Two groups of university students were instructed to perform
	only the SIZE task, after initial switching, either while ignoring
	the SHAPE cues ("Ignore") or while being prepared for the SHAPE task
	only when the cue appeared in red, which never happened ("Attend
	color"). AF's performance resembled the one of the "Attend color"
	group and not the "Ignore" group. The results indicate that AF had
	a partially activated intention to switch tasks. The implications
	to intentionality and task switching theory are discussed.},

  abstract = {Four experiments investigated the effect of recent selective practice
	on the cost of switching between 2 tasks afforded by letter-digit
	pairs: alphabet arithmetic and shape comparison. Experiments 1 and
	2 found a greater cost associated with switching to the more recently
	practiced task: evidence that task-set inertia contributes to switching
	costs. Experiment 3 found this effect to be limited to trials on
	which a recently trained stimulus followed another such stimulus:
	a result problematic for all current theories of task-set priming.
	Experiment 4 showed that the effect of recent practice was eliminated
	by active preparation for a task switch: It appears that endogenous
	task-set preparation reduces the effects of task-set inertia. ((c)
